## Usage
You can run the project in development mode from the main folder with **npm run dev**.

To initialize the database, run **npm run db:push**. 
Optionally, run **npm run db:seed** to seed the database with some sample data.

All necessary environment variables can be found in **.env.example**.

Commit messages must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification.

To get started uploading your own data directly from the website, initialize the database and log into the website. Afterwards, find your user in the database and give yourself admin privileges. You can now access the admin panel at **/admin**.
